#### Discrete Differential Geometry in Javascript ####

Differential geometry studies how differential elements like tangents and normals transform when mapped between spaces.  Surfaces, for example, can be mapped to a plane as long as you're allowed to stretch them out.  Differential geometry allows us to quantify how this stretching out affects the surface and any calculations we might want to perform on the surface.

Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG) is simple differential geometry applied to the discrete setting of polygonal meshes.  DDG is built on top of Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC), which is a unified framework for handling calculus over manifolds of varying dimensionality.  For a thorough and approachable explanation of DDG and DEC see the [Digital Geometry Processing with Discrete Exterior Calculus](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~keenan/Projects/DGPDEC/) Siggraph 2013 course notes.
